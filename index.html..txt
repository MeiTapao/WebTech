<p>Seems like everybody's falling in love except for me<br>
Maybe I, maybe I'll find love when I'm 23<br>
They say, "Boy, just make up your mind, you're wasting your time<br>
Waiting for someone who will set you free"<br>
Well, I'm sorry but I disagree<p/>

<p>And all the stars and TV shows<br>
Act like it's so wrong to be alone<br>
Why's it so hard for them to see?<br>
That I'm good by myself<br>
But that don't mean that I don't want that someone else<br>
To finally fall in love with<br>
'Cause I'm not lonely, but I'll take my one and only<br>
If she finds me, then I won't say no</p>

<p>I guess nobody finds the wrong way to do it right<br>
Maybe I, maybe I'll find love in another life<br>
Because I'd rather wait a million days than settle for a lie<br>
That fake love is a waste of time</p>

<p>If fairytales are overrated<br>
I don't mean to come off jaded<br>
But why can't you see I'm doing fine?<br>
'Cause I'm good by myself<br>
But that don't mean that I don't want that someone else<br>
To finally fall in love with<br>
'Cause I'm not lonely, but I'll take my one and only<br>
If she finds me, then I won't say no<br>
I won't say no</p>
